Four warning categories are available as Watch: Precipitation deficit, Warning: Soil moisture deficit, Alert 1: Vegetation stress following precipitation deficit, Alert 2: Vegetation stress following precipitation/soil moisture deficit.

                        <b>Overview:</b> The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is a widely used meteorological drought index that provides a measure of meteorological drought based on precipitation data. It was developed to standardize precipitation anomalies, making it possible to compare drought conditions across different regions with varying climates. The SPI is calculated for different time scales, typically ranging from 1 to 12 months or even longer. SPI-3 is commonly used for monitoring and detecting short-term drought conditions. It provides information on precipitation deficits over a 3-month period, helping to identify emerging drought situations. SPI-3 can also be used in the insurance industry to assess and manage the risk associated with short-term drought events. It provides valuable information for setting insurance premiums and developing risk mitigation strategies.<br />
