Title,Annual Land Cover of Cambodia
Abstract,"This landcover map provides detailed information on anual land cover types in Cambodia. It is intended for use in  natural resource management, planning and land use analysis.
The Cambodia national Land Cover time series (2000 - 2023) was developed through a collaborative effort led by SERVIR SEA using the Regional Land Cover Monitoring System approach (Saah et al. 2020). The maps were developed under the auspices of the REDD+ task team and the FCPF project in Cambodia to support the FREL. For this purpose, RLCMS was customized to meet Cambodia national land cover typologies. An uncertainty assessment was integrated into the assemblage process. These maps were developed using Landsat annual composites and training data collected by MOE."
